# Canto 8: The Surrendered Witnessing

As the group traveled towards Nest H, Dante began seeing into the memories that lingered in Hong Lu's mind, starting by witnessing his interactions with Lin Daiyu. Upon the Manager asking Hong Lu if he missed anyone, he said no, commenting that he had no need to see anyone as long as he believed them to be doing well. 

During their time in the arena, the LCB ended up teaming up with Lin Daiyu as she searched for her clan from which she'd been separated, making Daiyu able to see into Hong Lu's memories as well: Daiyu thus learned about Jia Mu's hand in the fall of the Kong family, and about the abuse Hong Lu had suffered from her and the Xianren, including their retaliation towards Xiren. As Daiyu questioned him about it, Hong Lu confirmed he had been too scared to share this with her, knowing that his actions wouldn't have changed anything, and that they would've only brought pain upon Daiyu as well.

Eventually, as Jia Qiu reminisced on what he had seen in Hongyuan and in the world outside, and the hardened hearts of people who simply accepted the way things are, Hong Lu considered his own childhood, and how he had often desired someone would comfort him and protect him; he then offered his honest belief that what Hongyuan needed was kindness. 

After a discussion with Jia Qiu, Hong Lu realized the Xianren might hurt Xichun, and voices his desire to protect his sister. The LCB thus hurried to catch up with her. 

During the combat with his grandmother, Hong Lu admitted to being tired of being bound to his role as a gem, doing nothing but glimmering for others, and as Jia Mu fell into Distortion, he began to reflect on the feelings of happiness, joy, sorrow and wrath that he had long seen in others, but always repressed in himself. 

With Dante's encouragement, Hong Lu accepted that he would have to recognize these feelings and accept their importance in order to truly live, even if they would one day change and disappear. As Dante reminded Hong Lu that he is a kind person and that the world is worth seeing through his eyes, Hong Lu told his grandmother that he wouldn't accept an eternity without these feelings, and that he knew Hongyuan would prosper without the Hierarch and their endless pursuit of immortality.

After the events of the Evaluations, Hong Lu does his best to fully experience and express his thoughts and feelings, now carrying forward with a genuine and radiant smile.
